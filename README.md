About-Me
This project is a simple, single-page portfolio website developed using Vue.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. This portfolio showcases background information about me as a developer and provides a summary of my main projects.
Structure
The project is structured into two main components:
AboutMe.vue - This component introduces who I am, my skills, and a bit about my background in software development.
ProjectSummary.vue - This component includes details about some of the main projects I've worked on.
Both components are styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a contemporary aesthetic and responsive design.

Vue.js - A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
